# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Project Summary
Employee attrition is the departure of employees from organization over time. Employee attrition can be voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary attrition is result of organization’s action where the employee is let go due to various reasons like performance. Voluntary attrition is when employee leaves the organization based on their discretion. Employee attrition that is voluntary can be due to various reasons like personal, job mismatch, retirement. Employee attrition is common in all organizations and if it is not managed properly, it can result in key members leaving the organization which in turn would result in decreased productivity.  The organization then have to hire and train new people which results in increased cost and is time consuming process. 

The project proposal is to predict employee attrition based on which companies can take certain actions to reduce attrition. As part of this project, company’s HR dataset will be analyzed to predict if an employee is likely to leave the organization. The dataset is first preprocessed to remove unnecessary variables. Data visualization is performed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). There are many features in the dataset, and they will be analyzed using EDA to look at some factors that affect attrition. The features required for machine learning model is selected and dataset is split into train and test. Machine learning models like Random Forest, Linear Regression will be applied, and performance will be evaluated. The model with best score is selected and tuned to improve performance. The tuned model is evaluated for prediction results.
